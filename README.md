# CSC1100-S-2021

Class repo for CSC1100 presented in the Spring of 2021.

## Readings and Projects

It is my practice to make assignments (readings and projects) available early. Please feel free to look them over and even to start them early.

*For projects: please don't hand them in until they are due or close to due.*

### Readings

You will find your reading assignments on Schoology.

### Projects

You will find specifications for projects here on Github.

## Importing a `repo` into repl.it

Along the top of repl.it web site you'll see a blue plus sign. Click this to add a new repl. Clicking on this will bring up a dialog with two tabs. 

The right hand tab is labeled `Import from Github`. Click on this.

Paste the following:

```text
https://github.com/pkivolowitz/CSC1100-S-2021
```

Click `Import`.

After the `repo` imports the settings should be visible. For `select language` erase the text that is there and enter `Python`. Make sure you do **not** select `Python 2.7`. 

Click `Done`.
