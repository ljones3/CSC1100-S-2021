# Ages

This exercise provides practice using:

* `if` statements 
* logical operators such as `and` and `or`
* `input()`
* conversion of a `str` to `int`
* `print()`

Write a program that asks for two ages (remember that these are to be integers).

Then based upon the ages print one or more the following:

* If both ages are 16 or more, print "Both can drive."
* If either ages are 25 or more, print "At least one can rent a car."
* If both ages are less than 35, print "Neither can be President."
* If *exactly one* age is 25 or greater, print "Only one can be a Senator."
